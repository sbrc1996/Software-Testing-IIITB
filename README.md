**SOFTWARE TESTING PROJECT: MUTATION & INTEGRATION TESTING **

The experiments for Mutation, Unit, and Integration Testing on a Codebase, together with their descriptions, are included in this report. For the purpose of executing and analyzing mutation testing, we utilized a Java codebase and PIT test suite.

**MUTATION TESTING**

Mutation testing is a software testing technique that involves introducing small, controlled changes (mutations) to the source code of a program and then running the existing test suite on the mutated code. The goal of mutation testing is to evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite in detecting and identifying these intentional mutations. The underlying assumption is that a good test suite should be able to catch and fail when the code is altered, simulating potential defects or bugs.


**TOOLS & LANGUAGE USED FOR THIS ENTIRE PROJECT**

1. JAVA - CODING LANGUAGE
2. INTELLIJ - IDE
3. JUNIT 3.0 - UNIT TESTING
4. PITEST - MUTATION TESTING
